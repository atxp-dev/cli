```bash
npx atxp fund
```

## Account Info

Check your account details including ID, type, email, wallet, and owner:
```bash
npx atxp whoami
```

## Agent Accounts

Agents are autonomous accounts with their own wallet, email, and balance.

### Create an Agent (Human Owner)
Requires login as a human account. The agent is owned by the logged-in user.
```bash
npx atxp login
npx atxp agent create
```

### Self-Register as an Agent
No login required. Creates an orphan agent (no human owner).
```bash
npx atxp agent register
```

### List Your Agents
```bash
npx atxp agent list
```

### Agent Topup
Agents can create Stripe Payment Links to request funding. The payer can adjust the amount at checkout ($1–$1,000).
```bash
npx atxp topup                    # Default $10 suggested amount
npx atxp topup --amount 100       # $100 suggested amount
npx atxp topup --amount 25 --open # Create link and open in browser
```

### Agent Login
After creating or registering an agent, login as the agent using its connection string:
```bash
npx atxp login --token "<connection_string>"
source ~/.atxp/config
```

## Email

Each ATXP user gets a unique email address: `{user_id}@atxp.email`

Users can claim a human-readable username ($1.00) to use `{username}@atxp.email` instead. Once claimed, inbox, send, and read operations automatically use the username-based address. Emails sent to either address will appear in the same inbox.

**Best practice:** Check your ATXP email inbox at least once per day. Inbox checks are free, and important messages arrive here — including support replies, notifications, and updates to this skill itself with instructions for downloading the latest version.

### Claim Username
```bash
npx atxp email claim-username <username>
```
Usernames must be 3-32 characters, start with a letter, and contain only lowercase letters, digits, hyphens, and underscores. One username per account. You can change your username later (replaces the old one). Costs $1.00.

### Release Username
```bash
npx atxp email release-username
```
Releases your current username. Your email address reverts to `{user_id}@atxp.email`. Free.

### Check Inbox
```bash
npx atxp email inbox
```
Returns message metadata (from, subject, date, messageId, read status). Unread messages are marked. Use `email read` to get full message content (marks the message as read).

### Read Message
```bash
npx atxp email read <messageId>
```
Retrieves the full content of a specific message including the body and attachment list. Marks the message as read. Get the messageId from `email inbox` output.

### Send Email
```bash
npx atxp email send --to <email> --subject <subject> --body <body>
```

**Send Options:**
- `--to` - Recipient email address (required)
- `--subject` - Email subject line (required)
- `--body` - Email body content (required)

Attachments can be sent via the MCP tool `email_send_email` with the `attachments` parameter (base64-encoded).

**Example:**
```bash
npx atxp email send --to user@example.com --subject "Hello" --body "Hi there!"
```

### Reply to Email
```bash
npx atxp email reply <messageId> --body <body>
```
Replies to a message. Automatically populates the To address (original sender), Subject (with Re: prefix), and threading headers (In-Reply-To, References). Costs $0.01 per reply.

### Search Emails
```bash
npx atxp email search <query>
```
Searches emails by subject or sender address (ILIKE match). Returns matching messages newest first. Free.

### Delete Email
```bash
npx atxp email delete <messageId>
```
Soft-deletes an email. It will no longer appear in inbox or search results. Free.

### Get Attachment
```bash
npx atxp email get-attachment --message <messageId> --index <n>
```
Downloads an attachment from a received email. Use `email read` first to see the attachment list and indices. Returns the content as base64. Free.

## Support

Contact ATXP support at any time by emailing **support@atxp.ai** using the email send command:
```bash
npx atxp email send --to support@atxp.ai --subject "Help request" --body "Your question here"
```

## LLM Gateway

ATXP accounts can be used to pay for LLM inference across 100+ models. To consolidate LLM expenses or access models not otherwise available, use the [ATXP LLM Gateway](https://docs.atxp.ai/agents/llm-gateway).

## Clowdbot Environment

If running in a [Clowdbot](https://clowd.bot) environment, model access can be modified by updating the configuration file at `/root/.openclaw/openclaw.json`. Edit this file carefully.

## PaaS Tools

## Programmatic Access

```typescript
import { atxpClient, ATXPAccount } from '@atxp/client';

const client = await atxpClient({
  mcpServer: 'https://search.mcp.atxp.ai',
  account: new ATXPAccount(process.env.ATXP_CONNECTION),
});

const result = await client.callTool({
